let x: number;   //* Explicitly declares x as a number type
let y = 1;       //* Implicitly declares y as a number type
let z;           //* Declares z without initializing it
let a: number = 0; // Explicite declares a as number type and init it.

// Types and subtypes in TypeScript

// Any : 
// ====
// All types in TypeScript are subtypes of a single top type called the any type. 
// The any type is the one type that can represent any JavaScript value with no constraints. 
// All other types are categorized as primitive types, object types, or type parameters. 
// These types introduce various static constraints on their values.

// Primitive types :
// ===============
// The primitive types are the boolean, number, string, void, null, and undefined types along with user-defined enumeration or enum types. 
// The void type exists purely to indicate the absence of a value, such as in a function with no return value. 
// The null and undefined types are subtypes of all other types. 
// It isn't possible to explicitly reference the null and undefined types. Only the values of those types can be referenced, using the null and undefined literals.

// Boolean 
let flag: boolean;
let yes = true;
let no = false;

// Number and BigInteger types
let x_2: number;
let y_2 = 0;
let z_2: number = 123.456;
// BigInt literals are not available when targeting lower than ES2020.
// let big: bigint = 100n;

// String type
let s: string;
let empty = "";
let abc = 'abc';

let firstName: string = "Mateo";
let sentence: string = `My name is ${firstName}. I am new to TypeScript.`;
console.log(sentence);


// Object types and type parameters :
// ================================
// The object types are all class, interface, array, and literal types (anything that isn't a primitive type.)
// Class and interface types are introduced through class and interface declarations and are referenced by the name given to them in their declarations. 
// Class and interface types may be generic types that have one or more type parameters.


// The enum type
// =============
// Enums allow you to specify a list of available options. 
// They're especially useful when you have a set of values that a particular variable type may take. 
// Let's imagine you have field in an external database called ContractStatus, which contains the numbers 1, 2, or 3, that represent the following contact statuses: Permanent, Temp, and Apprentice. 
// We'll create an enum with these values, and explore the TypeScript support.

// By default, enum values begin with a value of 0, so Permanent is 0, Temp is 1, and Apprentice is 2. 
// If you want the values to start with a different value, in this case 1, specify that in the enum declaration. 
// Make the following edits to have the enum start the values at 1.
enum ContractStatus {
    Permanent = 1,
    Temp,
    Apprentice
}

let employeeStatus: ContractStatus = ContractStatus.Temp;
console.log(employeeStatus);
// To display the name associated with the enum value
console.log(ContractStatus[employeeStatus]);




// Any type
// ========
// The any type is the one type that can represent any JavaScript value with no constraints
let randomValue: any = 10;
randomValue = 'Mateo';   // OK
randomValue = true;      // OK

// Because randomValue is registered as any, all of the following examples are valid TypeScript and will not generate a compile-time error.
console.log(randomValue.name);  // Logs "undefined" to the console
randomValue();                  // Returns "randomValue is not a function" error
randomValue.toUpperCase();      // Returns "randomValue is not a function" error

// Unknown type
// ===========

// While flexible, the any type can cause unexpected errors. To address this issue, TypeScript introduced the unknown type.
// The unknown type is similar to the any type in that any value is assignable to type unknown. 
// However, you can't access any properties of an unknown type, nor can you call or construct them.

let randomValue_2: unknown = 10;
randomValue_2 = true;
randomValue_2 = 'Mateo';

/* console.log(randomValue_2.name);  // Error: Object is of type unknown
randomValue_2();                  // Error: Object is of type unknown
randomValue_2.toUpperCase();      // Error: Object is of type unknown */


// Type assertion (Cast)
// =====================
// If you need to treat a variable as a different data type, you can use a type assertion. 
// A type assertion tells TypeScript you've performed any special checks that you need before calling the statement. 
// It tells the compiler "trust me, I know what Iâ€™m doing." 
// A type assertion is like a type cast in other languages, but it performs no special checking or restructuring of data. 
// It has no runtime effect and is used purely by the compiler.

// Type assertions have two forms. One is the as-syntax:
let castValueToString : string = (randomValue as string).toUpperCase();
console.log(castValueToString);

// The other version is the "angle-bracket" syntax:
let castValueToString_v2 : string = (<string>randomValue).toUpperCase();
console.log(castValueToString_v2);

// Type guards
// ===========

// You may be familiar with using typeof and instanceof in JavaScript to test for these conditions. 
// TypeScript understands these conditions and will change type inference accordingly when used in an if block.

// string 	typeof s === "string"
// number 	typeof n === "number"
// boolean 	typeof b === "boolean"
// undefined 	typeof undefined === "undefined"
// function 	typeof f === "function"
// array 	Array.isArray(a)



// Union types
// ===========
// A union type describes a value that can be one of several types. This flexibility can be helpful when a value isn't under your control (for example, values from a library, an API, or user input.)
// The any type can also accept different types, so why would you want to use a union type? The union type restricts the assignment of values to the specified types in the union, whereas the any type has no restrictions. Another reason is Intellisense support.
// A union type uses the vertical bar or pipe (|) to separate each type. In the following example, multiType can be a number or a boolean:
let multiType: number | boolean;
multiType = 20;         //* Valid
multiType = true;       //* Valid
//multiType = "twenty";   //* Invalid

function add(x: number | string, y: number | string) {
    if (typeof x === 'number' && typeof y === 'number') {
        return x + y;
    }
    if (typeof x === 'string' && typeof y === 'string') {
        return x.concat(y);
    }
    throw new Error('Parameters must be numbers or strings');
}
console.log(add('one', 'two'));  //* Returns "onetwo"
console.log(add(1, 2));          //* Returns 3
console.log(add('one', 2));      //* Returns error


// Intersection types
// ==================
// Intersection types are closely related to union types, but they're used differently. 
// An intersection type combines two or more types to create a new type that has all properties of the existing types. 
// An intersection allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need.
// An Intersection type uses the ampersand (&) to separate each type.
// Intersection types are most often used with interfaces. 
// The following example defines two interfaces, Employee and Manager, and then creates a new intersection type called ManagementEmployee that combines the properties in both interfaces.
interface Employee {
    employeeID: number;
    age: number;
  }

  interface Manager {
    stockPlan: boolean;
  }

  type ManagementEmployee = Employee & Manager;
  
  let newManager: ManagementEmployee = {
      employeeID: 12345,
      age: 34,
      stockPlan: true
  };


// Literal types
// =============
// A literal is a more concrete subtype of a collective type. What this means is that "Hello World" is a string, but a string isn't "Hello World" inside the type system.
// There are three sets of literal types available in TypeScript: string, number, and boolean. 
// By using literal types, you can specify an exact value that a string, number, or boolean must have (for example, "yes", "no", or "maybe".)

type testResult = "pass" | "fail" | "incomplete";
let myResult: testResult;
myResult = "incomplete";    //* Valid
myResult = "pass";          //* Valid
// myResult = "failure";       //* Invalid

type dice = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;
let diceRoll: dice;
diceRoll = 1;    //* Valid
diceRoll = 2;    //* Valid
// diceRoll = 7;    //* Invalid

type myType = true | false | "maybe" ;
let currentType: myType;
currentType = true;
currentType = false;
currentType = "maybe";


// Collection types in TypeScript

// Arrays
// TypeScript, like JavaScript, allows you to work with arrays. 
// Arrays can be written in one of two ways. In the first, you use the type of the elements followed by square brackets ([ ]) to denote an array of that element type:
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
// The second way uses a generic Array type, using the syntax Array<type>:
let list_2: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];

let list_3: Array<number> = new Array();
list_3.push.apply(list);

// Tuples
// Having an array of the same value types is useful, but sometimes you have an array that contains values of mixed types. For that purpose, TypeScript provides the Tuple type. 
// To declare a Tuple, use the syntax variableName: [type, type, ...].
let person1: [string, number] = ['Marcia', 35];
